# Adhoc Portfolio Tracking

This is the worst case fallback to track a particular broker. Make a manual portfolio and track the latest value using yahoo finance APIs which generally lag by ~15 mins. You will have to make manual changes after each trade. Hopefully you don't trade frequently with a broker who doesn't support APIs.

To setup, list your portfolio in config.json
