# IG

- IG unfortunately doesn't give any good APIs for share dealing accounts. In this script a browser is automated to login every time and fetch the price. Hence it is recommended to run this script infrequently so that your system isn't overloaded.
- Also you won't be able to integrate 2fac, which exposes your account to potential hacks. Although hackers will not be able to retrieve money from an account, they may be able to place trades on your behalf.
- This hacky approach also means that more maintenance will be needed if IG changes client side code.
